# Comprehensive Summary of Bachelor Project Report: Accenture Application Portal System

This extensive report documents the complete development lifecycle of a sophisticated bachelor thesis application management system for Accenture, undertaken by three Information Technology students from OsloMet (Alexander Cody McCorkle, Sindre Sauarlia, and Ã…dne Nilsen Longva) between August 2024 and May 2025. The project represents a comprehensive digital transformation initiative that revolutionized Accenture's previously manual and inefficient bachelor application process through the creation of two interconnected, production-ready web applications.

## Project Background and Current Situation Analysis

### Pre-Project Challenges

Prior to this digital transformation initiative, Accenture's bachelor thesis application process was characterized by significant inefficiencies and manual overhead. The existing workflow required staff to:

- **Manual Email Processing**: Receive applications via email with varying formats and structures
- **Data Extraction**: Manually extract applicant names, email addresses, and application content from email submissions
- **Document Management**: Download CVs, transcripts, and supporting documents from emails and re-upload them to shared OneDrive storage
- **Communication Overhead**: Create individual response emails for each applicant without guaranteed delivery confirmation
- **Administrative Burden**: Spend considerable time organizing and tracking applications across multiple platforms

This fragmented approach consumed significant human resources, created numerous opportunities for data loss or mishandling, and provided no systematic approach to application evaluation or candidate communication.

### Identified Improvement Opportunities

The comprehensive analysis revealed four critical areas requiring transformation:

1. **Operational Efficiency**: The manual workflow was highly repetitive, error-prone, and resource-intensive, requiring staff to perform redundant data entry and file management tasks
2. **User Experience**: Students faced uncertainty throughout the application process, with no confirmation of receipt, unclear submission requirements, and difficulty accessing current opportunities
3. **Evaluation Workflow**: Assessment processes were scattered across multiple documents and platforms, hindering collaborative review and consistent evaluation criteria
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Manual handling of personal data increased GDPR compliance risks and complicated data retention and deletion requirements

## Comprehensive Solution Vision and Strategic Architecture

### Dual-Application Architecture Strategy

The team developed an innovative solution comprising two specialized applications designed to serve distinct user populations while maintaining seamless data integration:

**Student-Facing Application Portal**: A public-facing web application optimized for user experience, accessibility, and conversion, designed to guide prospective applicants through a streamlined application process.

**Administrative Dashboard**: A secure, feature-rich management interface providing Accenture staff with comprehensive tools for application review, candidate evaluation, and process administration.

### Architectural Decision Rationale

The separation of applications was strategically motivated by several key factors:

- **Independent Availability**: System resilience ensuring student applications remain accessible even during administrative system maintenance
- **Security Boundaries**: Enhanced data protection through isolated access controls and authentication mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Tailored optimization strategies for different usage patterns and user requirements
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling capabilities based on varying load patterns between public and administrative interfaces
